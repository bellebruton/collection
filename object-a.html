    <h1>OBJECT A</h1> 
     
    <p>These are our two cats, Lou and Pumpkin. We adopted Lou march of 2019 from the Welland Cat Adoption Centre when he was about four months old. You could say it was love at first purr. This August I thought Lou would like a friend so we took a trip to the Adoption Centre and that is where we fell in love with Pumpkin. He was around a year old when we adopted him. Our cats are meaningful to me because they are like my babies, the're indoor cats so they stay warm and safe. They always give me love and keep me company.</p>
